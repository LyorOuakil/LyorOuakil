Hello ! 

My name is Lyor and I'm currently working as a web developer for almost 4 years now. I work as a fullstack Javascript developer. 
I'm currently learning Typescript, AWS as well as docker is main goal for the first quarter of the year 2022. 

This is my personal github and you gonna find mainly what goes through my mind, some projects that I try to make it real (I mean real... On production at least)

Welcome !
